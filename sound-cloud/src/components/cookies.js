            Cookies are small pieces of text which are downloaded to your device, for example, when you visit a website.

2. How do we use cookies?
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and improving your user experience. They can also help to ensure that ads you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

Spotify uses two main categories of cookie: (1) strictly necessary cookies; and (2) optional cookies:

1. Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are set by Spotify or a third party on our behalf, and are essential to enable you to use the features of our Services, such as technically delivering content, setting your privacy preferences, logging in, making payments or filling in forms. Without these cookies, our Services cannot be provided so you cannot decline them.

Optional cookies may be 'first party cookies' or 'third party cookies' as explained in the table below. Optional cookies also differ depending on the purpose they are used for, as explained in the first column.

First party cookies - these are cookies set directly by Spotify or by a third party at our request.

3. Options for managing cookies and interest-based ads
In this section we describe the different ways in which you can manage your cookie preferences, depending on the cookie type and your device type. You may need to combine two or more options to manage cookies on all of your devices.

Consent Management Platform
To allow you to manage your cookie preferences, Spotify uses something called a consent management platform or 'CMP', sometimes referred to as a 'cookie banner'. The CMP also allows us to maintain records of your consent. You may view the CMP and access your cookie settings at this link.

Using the CMP, you can:

consent to the setting of optional cookies by us and our third-party partners;
manage your preferences for how first party cookies are set according to the category of cookie, as described in Section 2 How do we use cookies?; and
manage your preferences for how third party cookies are set according to the purpose for which your data is processed or according to which third-party partners are involved. You may disable all third party cookies by toggling off the control next to 'store and/or access information' on a device; as set out above, certain third party optional cookie purposes are described as 'Always Active', however this means that if you do not wish cookie data to be processed for these purposes then you may toggle off this 'store and/or access information' control.
If you wish to update your consent choices via the CMP, please visit this link.

Please note that you will not be able to withdraw consent for cookies which are strictly necessary for the Service to operate.

Spotify participates in the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework and complies with its specifications and policies. We use a consent management platform ('CMP') with the identification number 28.

Web Browser Settings
You can also use your web browser settings to accept, refuse and delete cookies. To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the 'Help', 'Tools' or 'Edit' settings).

Mobile Identifiers
On your mobile device, your operating system may provide you with options to opt out of interest based advertising or to otherwise reset your 'mobile identifier' - a unique identifier that can be used to identify a mobile device which works in a similar way to a cookie. For example, you may use the 'Allow Apps to Request to Track' setting on iOS devices or the 'Opt out of Interest-Based Ads' on Android devices. These settings allow you to limit the use of information about your use of apps for purposes of serving ads tailored to your interests.

Interest-Based Advertising
You may opt-out of receiving interest-based advertisements by turning off the 'Tailored ads' toggle, located in the Privacy Settings page of your Spotify Account. If you opt-out of receiving interest-based ads using the Tailored ads toggle, Spotify will not share your information with third party advertising partners or use information received by them to show you interest-based ads. You may still receive ads when using the Services based on your Spotify registration information and your real-time usage of Spotify, but the ads may be less relevant to you.

Certain tailored advertisements that we, or a service provider acting on our behalf, display to you may include the 'Ad Choices' icon or another mechanism to opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements. You may click on the AdChoices icon or visit www.aboutads.info to:

learn more about the collection and use of information about your online activities for interest based advertising; or
opt out of having your data used for interest based advertising by Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) participating companies.
European users can also visit www.youronlinechoices.com to learn how to opt out of having their data used for interest-based advertising by European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) member companies.

We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.
